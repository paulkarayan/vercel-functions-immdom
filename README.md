# Basic API Examples with Vercel Functions

Intro

_REMEMBER: This ain't gonna work unless you push things up to Vercel!_

## Basics

### /api is special

Generally, adding an approved script to the /api folder will create a Function as a Service
endpoint at the file name's path. Nesting is allowed, as you can see with these examples.

```
/api/hello.js -> https://<APP_URL>/api/hello
/api/js/basic -> https://<APP_URL>/api/js/basic
```

See INSERT ME for more details.
